**Tariff Manifesto**

**Preamble: The Dragon's Decree**

Hear ye, hear ye, brave knights, traders, memelords, and speculators\! Let it be known far and wide that a great economic beast, Trampius Tarifficus, has risen from the depths of economic despair, donning armor crafted from tariffs and scales polished by political absurdity. Born in the fiery pits of global trade disputes, this dragon has vowed to protect domestic wealth through the noble art of punitive taxation.

**Article I: Philosophy of Tariffication**

The golden rule is simple: "Tax everything that moves, and twice if it moves across borders." Guided by this impeccable logic, Trampius Tarifficus ensures wealth redistribution from anyone not paying sufficient homage through exorbitant fees disguised as protective tariffs. Because fairness means everyone else paying more.

**Article II: Economic Principles (or Lack Thereof)**

Economics? Overrated. Supply and demand? An archaic conspiracy. Our dragon thrives on the universally recognized, time-honored principle: "If it tweets, tariff it\!" No good or service shall be exempt unless explicitly stated by royal decree (or after suitable flattery).

**Article III: Meme-based Economy**

In this glorious economic model, value derives exclusively from virality and meme-worthiness. Fundamentals, revenues, profits? Quaint notions of a bygone era. Instead, we champion the immutable laws of memes:

* Buy high, sell higher\!

* FOMO is thy shepherd; ye shall want everything thy neighbor hath.

* Logic is optional; hype is mandatory.

**Article IV: Tokenomics of the Realm**

Our coin ($TAR), is deflationary, inflationary, and stationary simultaneouslyâ€”perfectly reflecting real-world tariff policies. Each transaction incurs:

* A "Border Crossing" tax (because you never know).

* An "Import Fee" (applicable to buying).

* An "Export Duty" (because selling is suspect).

* A random tariff, periodically changed for no logical reason, announced exclusively through cryptic social media posts.

**Article V: Governance and Dictatorship**

Democracy is messy. Centralized control is efficient, stylish, and suitably draconic. Decisions are made exclusively by the dragon, executed spontaneously, without consultation, often late at night, and always to ensure maximum confusion and entertainment value.

**Article VI: Conclusion and Call to Arms**

We summon all brave-hearted speculators, fearless traders, meme aficionados, and tariff enthusiasts to unite under the wing of Trampius Tarifficus. Together, let us build an empire based on satire, hype, irrational exuberance, and, of course, arbitrary tariffs.

Let the memes flow, the tariffs rise, and the logic perish\!
